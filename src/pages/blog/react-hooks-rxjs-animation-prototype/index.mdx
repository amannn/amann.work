The introduction of React Hooks got me excited to try them out on an animation prototype. A [dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2189808-Imitating-UIKit-dynamics-physics) by [@tmgrhm](https://twitter.com/tmgrhm) looked like a good opportunity to me.

Such apps tend to have quite a bit of side effects if you don't use an abstraction which takes care of that. Also from my experience, building fancy animations usually makes code harder to read. That's why I thought it might be interesting to see if React Hooks are a good fit for this.

I initially tried running the animation loop via `setState`, but that turned out to be too slow. Therefore I wanted something that bypasses React altogether for my animation purposes: Introducing [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/). Observables are interesting for gestures where a single touch movement controls multiple effects.

In my case I'm reading `scrollTop` on every animation frame, feed that into a stream which all animatable elements subscribe to and transform it as necessary. Reading `scrollTop` via `requestAnimationFrame` produces better results in comparison to a scroll listener, as the latter can fire too often and cause jank. Therefore every frame starts with a single read operation from the DOM followed by a few write operations. That avoids [layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing) and reduces CPU work.

To me, the most promising aspect of Hooks was having another tool in the box to create abstractions for shared behaviour. This can lead to [slimmer components](https://twitter.com/jamannnnnn/status/1057025220362543116). Also `useEffect` seems much more ergnomic than `componentDidMount`, `-DidUpdate` and `-WillUnmount`.

The code is [available on Github](https://github.com/amannn/friends-ui).
