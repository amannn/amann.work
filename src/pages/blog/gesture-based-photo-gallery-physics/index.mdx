When animating elements, I think they should closely resemble phsyical objects from the real world. For this prototype I used spring equations in order to get a natural acceleration and deceleration feeling.

I think for animations which are based on single clicks or taps you can get pretty far with CSS transitions. However as soon as a user moves elements via touch gestures you need something much more dynamic. Elements should precisely follow touch movements and if a finger is released in the middle of a pan gesture, the element should continue that motion while a natural friction brings the object to a smooth halt.

There's an animation loop which runs 60 times a second and which incorporates velocity into coordinates of the photos using [Hooke's law](https://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS%20Concepts%20and%20Contexts/upfiles/3c3-AppsOf2ndOrders_Stu.pdf).

[Ralph Thomas](https://github.com/iamralpht) got me really interested in using physical models for animations. If you find this interesting, I can't recommend these two articles enough: [Creating Animations and Interactions with Physical Models](http://iamralpht.github.io/physics/) and [Towards declarative touch interactions ](http://iamralpht.github.io/constraints/).

The [physics utilities](https://github.com/amannn/photo-gallery/tree/master/src/utils/physics) for this experiment are based on [the implementation of Ralph Thomas](https://github.com/iamralpht/iamralpht.github.io/tree/master/physics).

Check out [the code on Github](https://github.com/amannn/photo-gallery).

**Update:** There's now a small library called [wobble](https://github.com/skevy/wobble) which implements spring physics. If that's all you need, this is your place to go.
