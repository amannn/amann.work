When writing music, I sometimes struggle with coming up with good chord progressions that lay the foundation for the song. It turns out that popular music follows [predictable patterns](https://www.hooktheory.com/trends) which can be calculated and therefore potentially automated.

After I recently experimented with [swipe gestures on the web](/blog/gesture-based-photo-gallery-physics), I was wondering if there would be a perceivable performance difference when you implement something similar with React Native.

My idea with this app is that the user can swipe through different moods to get matching chord progressions.

<Figure>
  <DeviceFrame>
    <ScreenVideo source={require('./demo.mp4')} />
  </DeviceFrame>
</Figure>

The Animated API works really well for this use case: You can create a single animated value that subscribes to the horizontal scroll position.

```jsx
const scrollValue = new Animated.Value(initialIndex);
```

In the render function, this can be interpolated into corresponding values for every single panel.

```jsx
Children.map(children, (child, i) => {
  // Don't render invisible panels
  const isVisible = Math.abs(index - i) <= 1;
  if (!isVisible) {
    return <View style={styles.panelPlaceholder} />;
  }

  const transitionValue = scrollValue.interpolate({
    inputRange: [i - 1, i, i + 1],
    outputRange: [-1, 0, 1]
  });

  return React.cloneElement(child, {transitionValue, isVisible});
});
```

A panel can take this value and interpolate it further to animate the opacity and position of the background, creating the fading parallax effect.

```jsx
const {mood, imageParallaxFactor, transitionValue} = props;

const imageOffset = viewWidth * imageParallaxFactor;

const imageOpacity = transitionValue.interpolate({
  inputRange: [-1, 0, 1],
  outputRange: [0, 1, 0]
});

const imageTranslateX = transitionValue.interpolate({
  inputRange: [-1, 0, 1],
  outputRange: [-imageOffset, 0, imageOffset]
});

const style = [
  styles.backgroundImage,
  {
    left: -imageOffset,
    width: viewWidth + imageOffset * 2,
    opacity: imageOpacity,
    transform: [{translateX: imageTranslateX}]
  }
];

return <Animated.Image style={style} source={mood.image} />;
```

This ensures that all animatable elements always operate in sync.

When the user releases the touch, `scrollValue` can be set to an integer, resulting in a single panel to be visible. For a natural feel, the current velocity of the panel needs to be incorporated via spring dynamics.

```jsx
// Decide based on the current drag position and
// velocity which panel should be visible.
const pageNumber = ...;

Animated.spring(scrollValue, {
  toValue: pageNumber,
  velocity: -gestureState.vx,
  friction: springFriction,
  tension: springTension
}).start();
```
