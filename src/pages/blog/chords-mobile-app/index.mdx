This app is my attempt at delivering a good user experience for an app that helps you to play and sing along to your favourite songs.

There's no sophisticated multi-level navigation—just your songs. I expect most hobby guitar players to not have a huge amount of songs anyway. A clear structure helps you to quickly identify the song you want to play.

If you happen to have a lot of songs, you can still use the search feature. But apart from showing you matchings songs from your favourites, this also searches for other matching songs through a remote API.

When you've decided for a song to play, you get an immersive, fullscreen experience. If you've ever been to a chords or tab website, you might notice that the positioning of the chords works without the need for a monospace font.

Furthermore, specific chords are always highlighted with the same colour, so if you've used the app for a bit, you might intuitively play the right chord just by subconciously noticing the respective colour.

From here you can also save the song as a favourite, or transpose the song up or down if you prefer to sing in a different pitch.

What enhances the experience is that the colour used for the play button is always computed dynamically from the shown image.

This is achieved through [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/)—a small colour extraction library. It's not much effort to implement, but I think it really improves the experience.

I'm a big fan of guiding the user with subtle, appropriate animations. I like motion that feels natural and guides the user, instead of drawing attention to itself.

Regarding technological aspects, the UI is built with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), Google's response to modern web development. Polymer leverages [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/), a new set of standards for building apps, that is being worked on by the W3C.

If you're a guitar player who is now convinced about using this app, I sadly have to disappoint you. As the legal aspects of chords and lyrics are fairly complex and the price for using such data isn't affordable with the earnings of a small app, I've put the project on hold and decided not to publish it.
